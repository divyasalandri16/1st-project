    <p> The name is DIVYA.</p>
<p>I'm seventeen years old.</p>
<p>I've two elder sisters and a younger brother and you got it right,I'm the third sibling.</p>
<p>I like keeping things to myself.</p>
<p>I dont talk unless the right time comes for me to talk.</p>
<p>I like to have the upper hand in few things.</p>
<p>I love to read,that's the world enclosed with my imaginations and I</p>
<p>I'm not the adventurous here, more like anti-adventurous.</p>
<p>I'm the nervous wreck when it comes to crowds. You see,they aren't my thing.</p>
<p>I happen to have an okayishhhh voice not that horrendous which might want you to keep a 100 metres distance from me.</p>
<p>I love to dance though I'm not veryy curvyy I can manage swaying my hips at right directions.</p>
<p>Looks might be innocent but I'm far from being one.</p>
<p>I'm a very creative person, even with wordssss.</p>
<p>Cussing is like enhancing the sentence, which happens to roll off my tongue very often(I might add).</p>
<p>I'm not a clingy person. I like to have personal space.</p>
<p>I believe in hardwork pays off not that I work my ass off but heeyy,I'm not the lazy-bug here.</p>
<p>I like to maintain a small group of freinds,likeee seriouslyyyy my friendship isn't free for people coming and being my friendssss.</p>
<p>I dont boss around ,its likee people like to get bossed by me.</p>
<p>I'm sure by now you might be tired reading this, so I'll end it heree.</p>
